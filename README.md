# Algorithms and Problem Solving Lab

This repository contains college lab exercises for Algorithms and Problem Solving course, implemented using Google Colab notebooks.

## 📚 About

This repository serves as a collection of practical implementations and solutions for various algorithmic problems and data structures covered in the Algorithms and Problem Solving Lab course. All exercises are designed to run on Google Colab, making them accessible and easy to execute without any local setup.

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Students/Users:

1. **Browse the Repository**
   - Navigate through the folders to find the specific lab exercise or algorithm you're interested in
   - Each notebook (`.ipynb` file) contains a complete lab exercise with explanations and code

2. **Open in Google Colab**
   - Click on any `.ipynb` notebook file in this repository
   - Click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of the notebook, OR
   - Click the "Open in Colab" button that appears in the GitHub preview
   - Alternatively, you can manually open Google Colab and import the notebook using the GitHub tab

3. **Run the Notebook**
   - Once opened in Colab, you can run cells individually by clicking the play button (▶️) next to each cell
   - Or run all cells at once: `Runtime` → `Run all`
   - Make sure you're signed in to your Google account to save any changes

4. **Make Your Own Copy**
   - To experiment and save changes: `File` → `Save a copy in Drive`
